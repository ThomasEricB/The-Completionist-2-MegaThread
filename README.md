[**As some of you might remember from the last time,**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCompletionist2/comments/18lsitu/megathread_archived_evidence_and_chronology_of/) the purpose of this huge post is to make everything relevant accessible in one single place, instead of flooding the subreddit with (honestly) undesirable posts.

Took a long time to write, upload the evidence and format this post so thanks for the support and positive feedback! If you have any suggestions or additions to this megathread, please comment below! - u/Thomas_Eric

# General FAQ by u/BitchIAmABus and the Moderation Team

> Alright, we're finally here. The FAQ many of you have been waiting for all of your life. **Any frequently asked questions that are answered in this megathread need to be discussed here or not at all. Any new posts in regards to these topics will get deleted.** - u/BitchIAmABus

## • *What does Greg think? Was Greg the tipster who tipped off Karl/Muta? What is Greg up to now?*

[**Greg is a private person who hasn't had anything to do with TOVG since 2015.**](https://superbeardbrothers.fandom.com/wiki/Greg) IndieLand started in 2018. [The split between Greg and Jirard was not a friendly one and Greg (probably) has zero insight into anything that happened at the company after his time.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180212180342/http://www.gramunion.com/alpinesofa.tumblr.com/163736630434) If Greg ever comes out and speaks about the situation we will allow posts about it, until then give him his privacy.

## • *Does Jamie Lee Curtis know what happened?*

[**Yes. She liked the Facebook post about Jirard's response.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCompletionist2/comments/18ncvsp/jamie_lee_curtis_liked_the_completionists_fb/) However, her due diligence stops when Jirard tells her where the money is going, even if he lied to her. The amount she donated is inconsequential to her and she likely won't cause drama with her daughter's former employer when her charity donates to many causes every year.

## • *What happened to the old subreddit?*

[**They began censoring posts and comments after Jirard's response video.**](https://web.archive.org/web/20231210173838/https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCompletionist/comments/18f5sl7/my_final_say_and_moderation_decisions/?rdt=36137) They were not able to handle the outrage caused by their poor decision to censor and went private. No one besides the mod team there can access the subreddit and only they know if the subreddit will ever come back. Also, at the time of shutting down, Jirard's brother, Jacque Khalil, started doubling down about lawsuits in the comments and replying to people with "🐑". 

## • *Will you start removing SmashJT or that one lawyer guy's videos? Is self-promotion allowed??*

**No, the mod team here will not indulge in content curation.** Yes, self-promotion is allowed as long as it doesn't become spam.


> By the way, there are a few reasons why we will not get into content curation. **The primary reason being it's a slippery slope that people will undoubtedly call censorship at some point.** We do not want to follow the other subreddit's footsteps. Another reason is that any attention brought towards this situation is better than it dying into obscurity. Many of these videos are made for people not familiar with this subject and the target audience is not the people who are viewing this subreddit daily. This community is already great at upvoting quality videos and downvoting low effort posts. Lastly, curating content takes a lot of time and myself and the mod team are not into that. We are here to make sure you guys aren't getting yourself or the subreddit into trouble and aren't crossing any lines. We are not here to influence the conversation that takes place, that is on all of you instead as the community. - u/BitchIAmABus
